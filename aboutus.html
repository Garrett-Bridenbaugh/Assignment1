      <h2 class="text-center">My Experience Making This Site</h2>
      <div class="row mt-4">
        <div class="col-md-10 offset-md-1">
          <p>
            Creating this site was a great way to apply what I’ve been learning in web development. I wanted it to feel clean and easy to use while showing off real estate data in a meaningful way. Getting the charts and layout to work across different screen sizes took some trial and error.
          </p>
          <p>
            I used Bootstrap for responsiveness, Chart.js for visualizations, and VS Code to keep everything organized. Working with real data made things more interesting—and more challenging—but it helped me see how design and functionality come together in real-world projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            I faced several challenges implementing the CRUD functionality, especially when trying to use user-defined inputs without direct access to the full dataset. Due to limitations in referencing live data, I had to hard-code some assumptions. In a real-world scenario, I would have connected to a live database using SQL to dynamically query the dataset and enable more robust and scalable data analysis.
